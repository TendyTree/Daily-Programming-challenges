The ability to securely access (replicate and distribute) directoryinformation throughout the network is necessary for
successfuldeployment.  LDAP's acceptance as an access protocol for directoryinformation is driving the need to provide
an access control modeldefinition for LDAP directory content among servers within anenterprise and the Internet. 
Currently LDAP does not define anaccess control model, but is needed to ensure consistent secureaccess across
heterogeneous LDAP implementations.  The requirementsfor access control are critical to the successful deployment anda
ceptance of LDAP in the market place.
This section is divided into several areas of requirements: general,semantics/policy, usability, and nested groups (an
unresolved issue).
The requirements are not in any priority order.  Examples andexplanatory text is provided where deemed necessary. 
Usability isperhaps the one set of requirements that is generally overlooked, butmust be addressed to provide a secure
system. Usability is a securityissue, not just a nice design goal and requirement. If it isimpossible to set and manage
a policy for a secure situation that ahuman can understand, then what was set up will probably be non-secure. We all
need to think of usability as a functional securityrequirement.
